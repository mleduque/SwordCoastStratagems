@21307 = ~Dagger "Nome Stikka"

Though kobolds do not normally wield poison daggers, it is evident that they have been given the means to make these. The crudeness of the construction of this weapon, however, does not lessen its deadliness - in fact, it can be just as deadly to the wielder as it is to the victim!

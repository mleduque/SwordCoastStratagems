@605 = ~SCS Ease-of-Use AI : ~
@606 = ~The AI has 5 functions:
1) The character will fight, prioritising opponents who are not immobile and helpless, not fighting if they're trying to Turn Undead, and not wasting Melf's Minute Meteors, Energy Blades or Invisibility. You can shift the character between melee (D) and ranged weapons (F) using the hotkeys. If you'd rather that your character did not enter melee, you can toggle melee off by pressing (K). Characters with melee toggled off will fight if enemies are in weapon range but won't be proactive about getting into range.
2) The character will cast some long-duration spells when out of combat. There are 4 settings for this, which you can toggle through using (S). On setting 1, the character uses no spells. On setting 2 and up, the character will cast all of the following spells if they are memorized (and not already active): Stoneskin, Iron Skins, Armor, Melf's Minute Meteors, Goodberry. 
3) On setting 2 and up, the character will consume Goodberries if injured and out of combat. On setting 3 and up, the character will also consume potions of healing. On setting 4, the character will consume potions of extra-healing.
4) On setting 2 and up, the character will automatically activate the following items once per day: the Cloak of the Stars; the Gargoyle Boots; the Girdle of Fortitude.
5) On setting 2 and up, the character will automatically cast low-level healing spells on the party if they have them. The casting is highly accelerated and cannot be done in combat; characters will only cast healing spells of a level 2 or more below the highest level of spells which they can cast.
6) The character will cast some spells, by hotkey, on the whole party. This casting is highly accelerated, cannot be done in combat, and only casts on characters who are not already protected. Its main function is for later in the game when you can afford to carry enough spells to protect the whole party. The hot-keys are: (C) for Chaotic Commands; (V) for Death Ward; (B) for Protection from Fire, Protection from Lightning, and Protection from Magic Energy; (Z) for a paladin's Protection from Evil.~

@611 = ~If enabled, the character will attack enemies on sight. If disabled, the character will only attack when enemies are within melee range. You can toggle this on and off for the selected character(s) using hot-key (K).~

Out of combat, the character will use low-level healing resources if needed, will activate long-duration once-per-day items, and can be instructed to cast long-duration defensive spells on the party, by hotkey: (C) for Chaotic Commands, (V) for Death Ward, (B) for Protection from Fire and Protection from Magic Energy, (Z) for a paladin's Protection from Evil.

@4200 = ~The journal is thick and filled out with various entries that are, at first, legible elvish... relating the writer's horror at being trapped in the maze, his frustration at the fact that even retracing your steps through a portal you have just traveled through will not lead you back to the area you just came from. The writer is obviously morose and guilty over abandoning his dead comrades, and his writing suffers over time...slowly degenerating into mad scribbles, paranoid ramblings about demons and wild, repeated references to 'Yakman' written all over the journal.

@22201 = ~Ho there, <CHARNAME>! Your foster father Gorion tells me that you need to leave the Keep at once. Your very life is in danger and there is no time to lose.~
@22202 = ~But before then, it's probably a good idea if you go round the Keep in a leisurely fashion finding lost property and running errands, all for an economically implausible cash reward and an astonishing amount of experience.~
@22203 = ~Sounds good, I'm on it.~
@22204 = ~Can't I just get the cash and experience right now? The longer I wait, the higher the chance that those first-level assassins in the Keep will finish me off.~
@22205 = ~Good luck, <CHARNAME>, and watch out for those rats. See you in Chapter Six.~
@22206 = ~I don't see why not. How much are you really going to learn about spell-throwing and swordplay by fetching crossbow bolts, after all?~
@22207 = ~Here's the cash and a couple of potions, and some random junk that you can probably sell to someone. Go do your shopping, then I'll take you to Gorion.~
@22208 = ~Ready to go, <CHARNAME>?~
@22209 = ~Yep, take me to Gorion.~
@22210 = ~No, I haven't finished shopping yet.~
@22211 = ~Actually, I thought I'd go and do all the quests anyway, and get twice the experience.~
@22212 = ~Right this way.~
@22213 = ~Very well, <CHARNAME>, but get a move on, I don't have all day.~
@22214 = ~In any case, you don't realise just how dangerous it is here for you. Those bounty hunters can do up to one point of damage per blow!~
